## New-to-ISMIR mentoring program
<br>
The New-to-ISMIR paper mentoring program program is designed for members new to MIR topics (early stage researchers in MIR or researchers from allied fields who wish to submit their work to an ISMIR conference) to share their advanced-stage work-in-progress ISMIR paper drafts with senior members of the ISMIR community (mentors) to obtain focused reviews and constructive feedback. The program is expected to supplement the already available generic submission guidelines and resources with paper specific feedback. The program is being run as a pilot in 2022, closely aligned with the ISMIR 2022 paper submissions deadlines.  

More information coming soon.
